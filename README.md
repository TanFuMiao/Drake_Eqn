# Drake Equation
R Shiny simulation of the Drake equation

R = the star formation rate. (normal distribution) < br / >
fp = the fraction of stars with planetary systems. (uniform distribution between 0 and 1) < br / >
Ne = the number of habitable planets in a planetary system. (normal distribution) < br / >
fl = the fraction of the habitable planets that developed life. (uniform distribution between 0 and 1) < br / >
fi = the fraction of planets with life form that developed intelligence. (uniform distribution between 0 and 1) < br / >
fc = the fraction of civilizations that perform interstellar communications. (uniform distribution between 0 and 1) < br / >
L = length of time for civilizations to transmit detectable signals in space. (normal distribution) < br / >
N = the number of civilizations that communication might be possible.
